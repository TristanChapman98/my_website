title: About me
---

I grew up in a small town called Sandhurst in the UK, around 40 minutes from London. I am half Slovak, half British; travelling through Europe to visit family when I was younger made me accustomed to different cultures and led to my desire to study and work in an international environment such as LBS. Throughout my undergraduate degree in Bristol, I worked for Hargreaves Lansdown in their Stock Transfers team. This experience developed my time management skills as it required balancing my academic and student representative responsibilities with commuting and working. I also got the chance to experience a fast-paced office environment and speak to clients and other institutions. I first became passionate about financial markets as a young teenager and have been looking to break into the industry to learn from a top institution. For my masters, I was looking to study in a school that considers applicants holistically and admits well-rounded and hard-working individuals. From my research, LBS seemed like the perfect place, it is a collaborative environment with excellent networking opportunities and outstanding professors. My time here so far has been dynamic and exciting, LBS is truly an amazing community to be part of. Outside of work and study, I love listening to and playing music, I used to play lead guitar in a band, being outdoors, exercising, meeting people, and a good game of pool or snooker.
