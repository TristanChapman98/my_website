# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_chal, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))


```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)


glimpse(yield_curve) #take a quick peep at the data

yield_curvedata <- yield_curve %>% #create dataframe that we will modify to reach desired plot
  group_by(duration, date) %>% #group by duration and date
  mutate(duration = factor(duration, levels = c("3-Month Treasury Bill", "6-Month Treasury Bill", "1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate", "3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate","20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate" ))) # create levels for the duration variable; arrange from lowest to highest time to maturity
 yield_curvedata #verify changes to the dataframe

c <- ggplot(yield_curvedata, aes(x = date, y = value, colour = duration)) + #plot yield changes over time
  geom_line()+ #produce line graph
  facet_wrap(~duration, ncol = 2, nrow = 5)+ #make different plots corresponding to each duration; show 2 plots per row
  theme_bw()+ #change background of plot to black and white
  theme(legend.position = "none")+ #eliminate legend
  labs(x = "Time", y = "%", title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960", #formalize axis titles and plot title
       caption = "Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+ #include source at bottom right corner
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 years", date_labels = "%Y")+
NULL

c #show the plot that we have created

```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)



yield_curve$year <- format(yield_curve$date, format = "%Y") #formatting date by year


plot2 <- yield_curve %>% #create dataframe that we will modify to reach desired plot
  filter(date >= "1999-01-01") %>% #filter plot2 so that dataframe only contains data from 1999-01-01 onwards
  mutate(month = month(date)) #create a new variable that indicates the month associated with each data point
  


  
  
a <- plot2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(maturity), y = value, colour = year,group= month))+ #plot maturity against value, grouping by month, coloring by year, and treating the maturity variable as factor
  geom_line() + #produce line graph
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol= 4)+ #make different plots corresponding to each year; organize into 4 columns
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("3m","6m","1y","2y","3y","5y","7y","10y","20y","30y"))+ #create discrte tickmarks for x axis according to time  to maturity
  theme(legend.position = "none")+ #eliminate legend
  labs(x = "Maturity", y = "Yield (%)", title = "US Yield Curve", #formalize axis titles and plot title
     caption = "Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+ #include source at bottom right corner
  
NULL
  
a #show the plot that we have created


```



### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)


yield_curve$year <- format(yield_curve$date, format = "%Y") #formatting date by year


plot3 <- yield_curve %>% #create dataframe that we will use to produce desired graph
  filter(duration %in% c("10-Year Treasury Rate", "3-Month Treasury Bill")) %>% #only include data corresponding to 10-Year Treasury Rates and 3-Month Treasury Bills
  filter(date >= "1999-01-01") %>% #only include data from 1999-01-01 onwards
  group_by(duration) #group data by duration
  
  
plot3 #verify changes to dataframe

b <- ggplot(plot3, aes(x = date, y= value, colour = duration))+ #create plot that shows the yield of the 10-Year Treasury Rates and 3-Month Treasury Bills over time
  geom_line()+ #generate a line graph
  theme_bw()+ #change plot theme to black and white
  labs(x = "Time", y = "%", title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury Rates since 1999", #formalize axis titles and plot title
     caption = "Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", colour = "Duration")+ #include source in bottom right corner
  NULL
  

b #show the plot that we have created


```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946


```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

plotmerged #verify changes to the joined dataframe

plotmerged <- plotmerged %>% #edit joined dataframe
  mutate(concave = pmax(spread,0), #create new column showing spread when spread is positive (when yield curve is concave)
         inverted = pmin(spread, 0)) #create new column showing spread when spread is negative (when yield curve is inverted)

kostisplot <- ggplot(plotmerged, aes(x=date, y=spread))+ #plot yields against time

  labs(x = "Time", y = "Difference (10-Year - 3-Month) Yield in %",
    title = "Yield Curve Inversion: 10-Year minus 3-Month U.S. Treasury Rates", #formalize axis titles and plot title
    subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly averages. \nShaded areas correspond to recessions", #add subtitle explaining the plot
